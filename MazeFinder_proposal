Project Title: Maze Finder

Team members: Puer (Paul) Liu and Joanne Lai

Description: 
Our project is aiming to find a solution to a maze given by the user using one Arduino board.
It will allow users to draw the map of a maze on the TFT display with the help of a joystick 
and a pushbutton: use joystick as a cursor to locate the position, and use pushbutton to put 
down a "block"( a certain aera that acts as the "wall" of the maze) . Also, user need to block 
the boundaries and tell Arduino which is the entrance and exit.

Milestones:
1.		Nov. 17
		UI design
		Allow user to draw the maze on the screen

2.		Nov. 20
		Record user drawing into 2-dimentional array
		Alert user for the boundary incomplection and other exceptions

3.		Nov. 26
		Implement algorithms that let AI find the exit of the maze
		Handle occations that some exceptions not filtered out at the drawing level

4.		Nov. 30
		Enable animation of our maze finder moving in the maze

5. 		Bonus Milestone
		Add texture to the wall and the floor, make our maze finder a "person" instead of
		a small rectangle.
